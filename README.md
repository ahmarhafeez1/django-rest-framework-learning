## Basic Concepts

Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. Some of the basic concepts of DRF include:

- Serializers: Used to convert complex data types into native Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types.
- Views: Similar to Django views but designed specifically for handling web APIs.
- ViewSets: A way of organizing similar views into a single class based on CRUD operations.
- URLs: Define the URL patterns for your API endpoints.

## Authentication

Authentication in DRF can be done using various methods, including:

- Session Authentication: Uses Django's session framework for authentication.
- Token Authentication: Uses a token-based authentication mechanism.
- Basic Authentication: Uses HTTP basic authentication.
- OAuth Authentication: Supports OAuth1 and OAuth2 authentication.

## Examples

This repository includes examples of using DRF for building Web APIs, including:

- Serializers for converting data types
- Views for handling API requests
- Authentication using various methods
